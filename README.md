# Name of Platfotm
**Name of Platform** is a platform where users can donate Ether to scientific works registered as NFT's. These NFT's can register other NFT's as reference and split the donatmion revenue with them, forming a big **funding graph** for scientific works. Anyone with an ethereum address can register a work as a NFT.

## Overview of the problem
The problem that this platforms aims to solve is twofold. It's a product of both inneficiencies in the funding of scientific endeavors and restrictions to the access of scientific information.
### Funding sources
Currently, the funding of scientific work comes mainly from these 3 sources:
1. Industry
2. Governments
3. Universities (many of which receive funding from the other 2 above)

Firstly, funding by part of the industry can be inneficient due to the fact that many sectors are dominated by a few big players. Because of that scientific advances in those sectors can be coopted by these agents' interest, which often are gonna be misaligned with innovation and aligned with the maintenance of dominance. Examples of that can be seen in episodes of conflict of interests (CoI) in scientific research in many fields, e.g. nutritional science [1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/food-company-sponsorship-of-nutrition-research-and-professional-activities-a-conflict-of-interest/0DC05EE7794D352882D2F089111A0449) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764435/).

Secondly, decisions taken by agents in government are driven, mainly, not by scientific, but by political agendas. Decisions in this sphere often represent advances that do not interest most of the people. We could come up with an endless list of examples, but there is a single one that will do the trick: the infamous Project Manhatam that developed the tech used in nuclear bombs cost about 2 bilion 1940s dollars (the equivalent of about 23 bilion in 2020s dollars).

Thirdly, in universities, decisions regarding the funding of scientific research are fairly centralized at the top of faculty. As such it is not only susceptible to bad calls by few people, but also by CoI, given the two points raised above and the fact that universities receive funding by the other 2 source types.

The fact of the matter is that, currently, there is a lack of a system in which individuals can _directly_ contribute to scientific projects. This role is instead delegated to the aforementioned organizations. Even if there is a platform that can provide this, it is relatively difficult to raise popular funding to abstract projects with high levels of expertise that most people lack.

<Solution:> An alternative to mitigate this is to enable the authors of past scientific works, that have already produced concrete results and had significant impact in society, as judged by the very people who benefited from it, to receive contributions for their work. This possibility can, not only enable these scientists to fund other projects, nut also serve as a incentive to scientific development. Blockchain is arguably the most powerful tool ever created in regards to the funding of public goods. LET'S LEVERAGE IT TO CAUSE A HUGE IMPACT IN SCIENCE!!!

### Access to scientific information
It should be uncontroversial to say that scientific info should be open to all. The more open it is, the greater the probability of a scientific breakthrough happening. Today, very important scientific works are often hidden paywalls and owned by a few big platforms. That is mainly due to the model of funding oulined above. 

<Solution:> A platform tha enables authors to obtain revenUe for their work while keeping it in the PUBLIC DOMAIN.
